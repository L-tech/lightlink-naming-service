# LightLink Naming Service (LNS) with On-Chain Rewards Functionality

## Overview

The LightLink Naming Service (LNS) is a blockchain hackathin project designed to simplify the interaction with blockchain addresses through human-readable names. In addition to providing an intuitive naming system, LNS integrates a unique on-chain rewards functionality, incentivizing users through Experience Points (XP) tokens for engaging with the platform and participating in various activities. This project aims to enhance user experience in the blockchain space, making it more accessible and enjoyable for both newcomers and seasoned users.

## LNSJS For Integration
[lnsjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lnsjs) is a JavaScript library designed to simplify the integration and interaction with the LightLink Naming Service (LNS) directly from your web applications or Node.js projects. Inspired by the functionality and ease of use of ensjs, lnsjs provides developers with a set of tools to perform name registrations, lookups, and manage on-chain rewards within the LNS ecosystem efficiently.

## Features

- **Human-Readable Names**: Replace complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names, improving the user experience for transactions and interactions on the blockchain.
- **On-Chain Rewards**: Earn XP tokens by registering names, renewing your subscriptions, adding records, participating in governance, and engaging in community activities.
- **Dynamic Leveling System**: Gain levels as you accumulate XP, unlocking new benefits, discounts, and privileges within the LNS ecosystem.
- **Token Burn for Discounts**: Utilize your XP tokens to obtain discounts on services, with a mechanism to burn tokens, ensuring a balanced and sustainable economy.
- **Decentralized and Secure**: Built on blockchain technology, ensuring that the naming and rewards system is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship.
